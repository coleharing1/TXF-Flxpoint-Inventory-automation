Short answer: **Yes—use Playwright’s recorder (“codegen”)** to *watch what you click* and spit out working code. But before you automate the UI, note that **FLXPoint already supports scheduled exports natively**, which may eliminate the need to script clicks at all.

---

## Option A (no code): Use FLXPoint’s built‑in scheduled exports

* **Automated Exports** let you schedule daily exports of **Product Catalog**, **Source Inventory**, or **Channel Listings** and deliver them via **S3 HTTP (download link)** or **FTP/SFTP**. This is the simplest “run every day” path. *Caveat:* Automated Exports send **all SKUs** (no filters). ([Flxpoint Support][1])
* If you need **filters or custom field mapping**, set up a **Custom Export Operation** (under *Channels*). You can choose fields, format (CSV/TSV), and **schedule it**; filters like “only in‑stock” or a specific brand are supported. ([Flxpoint Support][2])
* For ad‑hoc/manual exports with filters and dynamic field mapping, there’s also a standard **Exporting** flow from the UI. ([Flxpoint Support][3])

> If these built‑ins cover your export, they’re far more reliable than automating clicks.

---

## Option B (code): Let Playwright **record your clicks** and generate a script

### 1) Record your flow (no hand‑coding required)

* Install Playwright, then **record** your login → Products → Product Catalog → Export flow:

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  npm i playwright
  npx playwright install
  npx playwright codegen https://app.flxpoint.com/login
  ```

  A browser pops up—sign in and click through exactly what you do. Playwright will **generate code as you click** and suggest robust, auto‑waiting locators. Copy the code when done. ([Playwright][4])

* Prefer to use Chrome DevTools’ Recorder? You can add a small DevTools extension to **export to Playwright** from the Recorder panel. ([Chrome Web Store][5], [Chrome for Developers][6])

* While refining, the **Playwright Inspector / UI mode** lets you *pick locators* and step through actions visually—handy when a selector is finicky. ([Playwright][7])

### 2) Avoid logging in every run (save your session once)

After a successful manual login, save an **authenticated storage state** (cookies, local storage) and reuse it on future runs so the script starts already signed in:

```js
// after login
await context.storageState({ path: 'auth.json' });
```

Then create contexts with `storageState: 'auth.json'` in later runs. ([Playwright][8])

### 3) Example skeleton you can paste and adjust

Use the selectors the recorder generated for your specific account/tenant. The ones below are placeholders to show the pattern (replace with the codegen output).

```js
// export-flxpoint.js
require('dotenv').config();
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

const AUTH_FILE = 'auth.json';

async function ensureAuth(browser) {
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://app.flxpoint.com/login');
  // Replace these with the recorder's locators for your login form:
  await page.getByLabel('Email').fill(process.env.FLXPOINT_EMAIL);
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(process.env.FLXPOINT_PASSWORD);
  await Promise.all([
    page.waitForNavigation(),
    page.getByRole('button', { name: /sign in/i }).click(),
  ]);

  await context.storageState({ path: AUTH_FILE }); // reuse later
  await context.close();
}

async function runExport(browser) {
  const context = await browser.newContext({
    storageState: fs.existsSync(AUTH_FILE) ? AUTH_FILE : undefined,
    acceptDownloads: true, // allow file downloads
  });
  const page = await context.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://app.flxpoint.com/'); // or a direct Products URL if your recorder captured it

  // Use the recorder's robust locators here:
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: /products/i }).click();
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: /product catalog/i }).click();

  // If you apply any filters, add those steps from codegen here.

  // Start waiting for the download, then click the Export action
  const downloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: /actions/i }).click();
  await page.getByRole('menuitem', { name: /export/i }).click();
  // If a dialog with templates/fields appears, select accordingly (use codegen output)

  const download = await downloadPromise; // export file starts downloading
  const dir = path.join(__dirname, 'exports');
  fs.mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
  const filename = `flxpoint-product-catalog-${new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)}.csv`;
  await download.saveAs(path.join(dir, filename));

  await context.close();
}

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  if (!fs.existsSync(AUTH_FILE)) {
    // first run: log in interactively (or with env vars) and save session
    await ensureAuth(browser);
  }
  await runExport(browser);
  await browser.close();
})();
```

* The `getByRole/getByLabel/getByText` locators **auto‑wait** for elements to be ready, so your clicks are far less flaky than with manual `wait` calls. ([Playwright][9])
* File downloads are handled via `page.waitForEvent('download')` and `download.saveAs(...)`. ([Playwright][10])

> Keep credentials in environment variables (e.g., `.env` with `FLXPOINT_EMAIL`/`FLXPOINT_PASSWORD`), never in the script.

### 4) Run it every day

* **Linux/macOS (cron):**
  `0 6 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/export-flxpoint.js >> /var/log/flxpoint-export.log 2>&1`
* **Windows:** Task Scheduler → new task → run `node C:\path\export-flxpoint.js`.
* **GitHub Actions (runs in the cloud):**

  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/flxpoint-export.yml
  name: FLXPoint Daily Export
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: "15 9 * * *"  # daily 09:15 UTC
    workflow_dispatch:
  jobs:
    run:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
          with: { node-version: 20 }
        - run: npm ci
        - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
        - run: node export-flxpoint.js
          env:
            FLXPOINT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.FLXPOINT_EMAIL }}
            FLXPOINT_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FLXPOINT_PASSWORD }}
  ```

## Which should you choose?

* If you export **everything** or can model your needs with FLXPoint’s **Custom Export Operation** (filters + schedule), use the **built‑in scheduler**—no scripts to maintain. ([Flxpoint Support][1])
* If you truly need the UI to do bespoke steps, **Playwright + codegen** is the modern, recorder‑driven way to “teach” the script by clicking once yourself. ([Playwright][4])

If you tell me **which exact export** you run today (all SKUs vs. filtered, and CSV field mapping), I can either (a) outline the exact clicks for codegen, or (b) walk you through the FLXPoint screen‑by‑screen setup for a scheduled export so it runs daily without any automation at all.
